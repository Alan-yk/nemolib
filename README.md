nemolib
=======

Description
-----------
The nemolib library includes tools specifically designed for executing the 
NemoProfile algorithm. Classes have also been designed with parallelization in 
mind.

Prerequisites
-------------
* The nemolib library has only been tested in a Linux operating environment.
* A copy of the Nauty Traces "labelg" binary for your execution environment. 
You can download labelg from " ". By default, nemolib will search for the 
labelg binary in 


Future Project Ideas
--------------------
* Implement the nauty algorithm in Java and include it as a dependency in nemolib.
* Hadoop-based implementation using nemolib.
* Spark-based implementation using nemolib.
